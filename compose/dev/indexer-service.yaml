# Indexer Service Dev Override
# Mounts a locally-built binary for WIP development (skip image rebuild).
#
# Set INDEXER_SERVICE_BINARY to the path of the locally-built binary, e.g.:
#   INDEXER_SERVICE_BINARY=/path/to/indexer-rs/target/release/indexer-service-rs
#
# Build the binary locally first:
#   cargo build --release --bin indexer-service-rs
#
# Activate via COMPOSE_FILE in .env:
#   COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yaml:compose/dev/indexer-service.yaml
