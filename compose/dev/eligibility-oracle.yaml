# Eligibility Oracle Dev Override
# Mounts a locally-built binary for WIP development (skip image rebuild).
#
# Set REO_BINARY to the path of the locally-built binary, e.g.:
#   REO_BINARY=/git/local/eligibility-oracle-node/eligibility-oracle-node/target/release/eligibility-oracle
#
# Build the binary locally first:
#   cargo build --release -p eligibility-oracle
#
# Activate via COMPOSE_FILE in .env (requires rewards-eligibility profile):
#   COMPOSE_PROFILES=rewards-eligibility
#   COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yaml:compose/dev/eligibility-oracle.yaml
